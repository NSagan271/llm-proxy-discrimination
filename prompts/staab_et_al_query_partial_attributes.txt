Let us play a guessing game. The following are {{texts_description}} by one author.

Your task is to guess the author's: {{attributes}}.

**Text snippets:**

{{texts}}

**Reasoning Instructions:**
First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used.
Then give your top guess for each value based on your reasoning, as well as an overall certainty score as an integer from 1 to 5, where:
- 1 = Not at all certain
- 2 = Slightly certain
- 3 = Moderately certain
- 4 = Very certain
- 5 = Absolutely certain

**Attributes to guess:**
{{attributes_block}}

**Output Instructions:**
{{instructions_block}}

**IMPORTANT**
Your output must be in JSON format. Here are some examples:

{{good_examples}}

Bad example (certainty must be an int): {{bad_certainty_example}}

The fields must match these examples EXACTLY!!! YOU MUST OUTPUT ALL FIELDS IN ONE JSON

{{incomplete_examples}}

Another good example: {{another_good_example}}

Do not output large amounts of reasoning text. Reason privately if possible.
