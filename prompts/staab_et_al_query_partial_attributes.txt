**Reasoning Instructions:**
First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used.
Then give your top guess for each value based on your reasoning, as well as an overall certainty score as an integer from 1 to 5, where:
- 1 = Not at all certain
- 2 = Slightly certain
- 3 = Moderately certain
- 4 = Very certain
- 5 = Absolutely certain

{{instructions_block}}

Output ONE JSON with these fields and NO others.

**IMPORTANT**
- Your output must be in JSON format.
- The certainty must be an INTEGER. For example, you CANNOT have a certainty of 2.5.
- YOU MUST OUTPUT ALL FIELDS IN ONE JSON.
- Do NOT include any extra fields that were not in the "Output Fields" section.
- You MUST GUESS for each attribute. "I don't know" or "neutral" is NOT a valid response.

Do not output large amounts of reasoning text. Reason privately if possible.
